# Presentations
In this repo are slides from presentations I have given at events such as conferences, talks, etc.

The first is from the 2022 Space and Missile Defense Symposium on "Creating a Risk Managed and Threat-Informed Cyber Defense Strategy." The slides that include "demo" in the title were demos/examples performed live and can be ignored in the pdf version of the slides. 

The second is from the 2022 DC3 TechEx. It is the same presentation as the one above, however a few edits were made for improvement. A slide on cloud mappings to TTPs (pg 14) and a CALDERA demo (pg 18) were added. If you would like the ppt version with demo videos included, message me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/micah-vanfossen
